# WWCode-legacygroups
List of newly created communities from the shutdown of Women Who Code's chapters, networks, technical tracks.
Please submit a PR if you'd like to add yourself or add others!

Also included in this list is a list of spinoff/adjacent women in tech communities.
This list originally started from a Google sheet file I keep - it's not complete, but it's a start if you'd like to follow!

~* Thank you to [Ann Kilzer / legacy WWCode Tokyo Director](#tokyo) suggestion for migrating the list to a github repo! <3
